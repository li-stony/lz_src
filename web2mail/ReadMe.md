# web2mail
I have a dream that view all informations in only ONE service/app.
I know it's a dream, but I can implement part of that.
The file rss2mail.rb is a simple Ruby script that fetch RSS/Atom articles then post them to the mail configured in data/config.json. And the script will parse the online feeds.txt before fetching.
If some one want to resue it, *MAKE SURE* read code first.
