# gfw2pac
I want to write a version of myself for a long time. Now it comes true.  
## Usage
>`PS>getlist.ps1`   
>`PS>topac.ps1`   

The outfile **gfwlist.js** is used for testing, which include some testing codes. 
I just run `node gfwlist.js` to test the method `FindProxyForURL`.   
After all testes passed, I can use the file **gfwlist.pac** in Browsers.
