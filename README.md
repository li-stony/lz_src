# LZ_SRC

I would update this file every time I add project or release a milestone. So I can trace my actions well if all in one repository.

> Add 'LzProfile.ps1', which is used as my $profile file for PowerShell and PowerShell ISE. I don't copy this file into ~\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Microsoft.PowerShellISE_profile.ps1 and ~\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1, but create SymbolicLink files instead. So I can just modify one file.
